Successfully passed the test of raising error after input equal to a letter in the used letters after change: 
I just added a if-else statement to determine if the letter was already in the list of used words, if so, an error would be raised.

Successfully passed the test after player loses.
After the user lose, I disabled the button. Because I did it, I had to remove the bind () of the input area to be able to disable the player to guess a letter after they lost.
