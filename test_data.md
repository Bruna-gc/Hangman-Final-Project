Successfully passed the test of double words after change: 
The problems was the assignments of key/value pair in dictionary.
Key: letter / value: tkinter label. 
I changed to key: tkinter label / value: letter

![equal_input](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8fe182-7093-45e2-bcc4-cb5475789245)
Successfully passed the test of raising error after input equal to a letter in the used letters after change: 
I just added a if-else statement to determine if the letter was already in the list of used words, if so, an error would be raised.
