# Hangman-Final-Project

Final project of Software Development summer class

TODO: Create a document of your project, what you have completed, what problems you have, and what is your next step.

So far I have completed the terminal base of my Hangman game to have all the basic logic ready to implement in a GUI.
Also, I have created a simple GUI with basic tkinter modules to explore possibilities.
I created another file for the game, now with EasyFrame from breezypythongui, in which I connected the logic and the GUI attributes and interface.

I had some trouble with the last file to implement the logic and the interface, but I could implement those after some thought. I am currently having some trouble with the "used letters" that I want to display for the hangman game.

The next step is to implement the ideas of all my test files together to build the complete final project.

Currently, I am almost finished with the main window and I have to do the history window.
