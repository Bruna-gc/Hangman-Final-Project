TODO: Create a document of your project, what you have completed, what problems you have, and what is your next step.

So far I have completed the terminal base of my Hangman game so that I have all the basic logic ready to implement in a GUI.
Also, I have created a simple GUI with basic tkinter modules to explore possibilities.
I created another file for the game, now with EasyFrame from breezypythongui, in which I connecated the logic and the GUI attributes and interface.

I had some trouble with the last file to implement the logic and the  interface, but I could implement those pretty well.

The next spet is to implement the idias of all my tests files  together to build the complete final project.
